## Self-Reflection:
Phaser seems like a cool thing but it does not seem to work all the time. I still hate GitHub and the Pages because it is very slow and does not help when I want to figure out if its working. Like this one. I thought this would be a fun one to create and it does not work. The site and the source code does not work. I just don't understand what we are learning from this. Error is "Access to XMLHttpRequest at ..... from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy" I don't understand how to fix it. Now its working on GitHub and I don't understand.

### How long it took me to finish this?
1 Hour
